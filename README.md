# Live-Chat-Room
this is a basic live chat room that I completed using Python ,Flask ,socketio .And of course , using the basic HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT .There are still a lot of room for updates on this app since I completed it in 4 hours , for example I didn't implement a backend authentification since the users are stored locally with session .
